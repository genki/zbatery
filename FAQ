= Frequently Asked Questions about Zbatery

Be sure to check out the Rainbows!
{FAQ}[http://rainbows.bogomips.org/FAQ.html] and the Unicorn
{FAQ}[http://unicorn.bogomips.org/FAQ.html] as well.


=== Mongrel -> Unicorn -> Rainbows! -> Zbatery.  Why another server?

Not everybody can afford to run a master process or multiple worker
processes.  Nor do they need all the Unix signals support from
Rainbows!/Unicorn.  We hope this is actually a temporary project that
can eventually be folded back into Mongrel.


=== Why not stick to Mongrel?

Unfortunately Mongrel 2.x development has stalled and the majority of
the team is busy with other projects.  However, Unicorn and Rainbows!
development continues with less concern for portability.

Rainbows! is the only Ruby web server we know of that supports a wide
variety of concurrency models, so we decided to take advantage of
the options Rainbows! provides instead of being tied to one.


=== What's Rack?  Do you support Rails?

{Rack}[http://rack.github.io/] is a minimal specification between
Ruby web servers (e.g. Mongrel, Zbatery) and Ruby web frameworks (e.g.
Rails, Sinatra, Camping).  Instead of requiring a new handler for every
framework a server wants to support, web servers only need to support
Rack.  As of late 2009, all major Ruby web frameworks are built on top
of Rack, including Rails.


=== What platforms are supported?

Any platform running matz's Ruby 1.8 or 1.9 should work with Zbatery.
We have not tested on anything other than GNU/Linux and FreeBSD, so
please let us know of your success/failure stories.  Rubinius 1.0.0rc1
appears to work, too (if you're using Unicorn 0.95.2 or later).
